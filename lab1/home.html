		<b>Welcome to 423401 Web Application</b><br>
		<pre>	The first step of this course is designed to be taught HTML by using Notepad because students need to 
know the tags and its attributes so that they can control the look and feel of their web pages. By using
Notepad as an editor to create web pages.,students have to type all the HTML tags and its attribute to
make them look more professional. this way can be ensured that all students can make some changes
they need by going inside of the source code. The is an important step for students to star before going to 
write PHP code.   </pre>
		<pre>	I wish all of you will become an expert in the near future.</pre>
